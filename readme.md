LIVE DEMO: https://napolitanj.github.io/Battleship2

A game of Battleship made according to the standards set by the project in The Odin Project.

My goal with this project is to demonstrate proficiency with Test Driven Development, the module pattern, and factory functions.

## Version 1.0

How to use this app:

Click on the computer board (on the right) to fire. White shots are misses, red shots are hit. The computer will fire at your board at random. When a ship sinks, an X will appear next to it. When the game is over, refresh your page to start a new game.

Planned updates will include:

- Custom ship placement
- The ability to resart the game without page refresh.
